                <h2>In the Context of Health</h2>
                <p>
                    Excessive Usage of phones may damage physical and mental health in a broad way. When we look to physical health excessive usage of phones may lead to damage eye causing short sightness
                    or acute photophobia (sensitivity to light), or may cause damage in bone joints or cause Herniated disc, or germs and bacteria transmission. Mental health can also be affected as well as physical health and the major effect causes sleeping issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's discuss some of these effects..
                </p>

                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, smartphone culture is reducing the amount of long-distance focusing we do every day, instead staring for hours at a few inches away from our face.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Short wavelength blue light emitted by smartphones and other types of screens can cause eye strain and pain. This type of light may even damage the cornea and impact vision.
                        Also blue light may contribute to <b>heart disease</b>, <b>diabetes</b> and other health conditions.
                    </p>

                <section id="hand">
                    <h3>Damage to Hands and Fingers</h3>
                    <p>
                        The term <b>"text claw"</b> describe the cramping and pain caused by too much mobile phone usage. Holding you fingers in the same position for a while can cause inflammation and tendon issues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Excessive texting on smartphone may lead to <b>trigger finger</b> or <b>trigger thumb</b>. This is a condition where the thumb gets stuck in a bent position and then pops when you try to get it straigh.
                        The condition is caused by inflammation of the tendon in the thumb.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Sleeping Issues and Mental Health</h3>
                    <p>
                        As we discuss previously, blue light of screens has a bad effect on physical health, Also it affects mental health causing sleeping issues.
                        Exposure to this wavelength of light disrupts <b>circadian rhythms</b>. Exposure to blue light in darker areas interferes with sleep.
                        Our eyes are accustomed to absorbing blue light from the sun, so when we get it at night it disrupts the circadian rhythms, that cause laziness in day and activity in night.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Regardless the effect of sleeping issues on mental health, Mental health is affected in many other ways due to excessive usage of phones.
                        A study from National Institutes of Health tell us that <strong>brain activity</strong> is increased by 7% while a cellular phone kept close.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, people thinking that their cell phone was vibrating. In a survey, 89% of undergraduates reported thinking that their mobile was vibrating even when it was not.

                <h2>In the Social and Psychological Context</h2>
                <p>
                    On the social and psychological level, People who are distracted by smartphones when they are with others miss out on important in-person interactions and connections.
                </p>

                    <h3>Social Connection</h3>
                    <p>
                        Believe it or not, even the presence of a smartphone when people are interacting in person decreases closeness and trust between people. It also reduces people's ability to feel empathy and understanding from those who they were with.
                        Studies reveal that frequent peeks at your device might damage your friendships as much as your eyes. A 2012 University of Essex study found that the mere presence of a mobile device can make people have a negative impression of us.

                    <p>
                        Smartphones are a deceptively easy way to spread rumors, gossip, and bullying.  Although your family may not be the ones starting mean stories, they can still be easy targets to its poisonous venom.  Social media as an extension of our phones is proving to be a subtle but deadly danger among children as young as 11 and 12 years.
                        Depression, low self-esteem, and social isolation are all potential hazards of too much smartphone, tablet and social media exposure, particular late at night.  By constantly seeing what “everyone else” is up too, increased smartphone exposure may indirectly affect our own decision-making and self-worth.

                <p>
                    Unlike many of our computers, our smartphones are ALWAYS with us and many of us rarely turn them off. However, consumers need to be aware of the kind of information that can be collected by various entities from your smartphone.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Service providers collect data, but the details of what they are collecting are not clear. Service providers may be collecting:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the phone numbers you call, the numbers that you receive calls from, and the time of the call;</li>
                    <li>the phone numbers you send texts to and receive texts from;</li>
                    <li>How often you check your e-mail or access the Internet;</li>
                    <li>Your location.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>
                    In addition to the data collected by your service providers, you should also be aware of the possible privacy issues surrounding the collection or disclosures of:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Photos or video you take on your phone;</li>
                    <li>Text messages and e-mails you sent and received on the device;</li>
                    <li>Who called you, who you called, when it was placed and how long it lasted;</li>
                    <li>The contacts you have stored in your phone;</li>
                    <li>Passwords;</li>
                    <li>Financial data;</li>
                    <li>What is stored in your phone’s calendar;</li>
                    <li>Your location, age, and gender.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>
                    Who would be interested in the data on your smartphone? Companies, advertisers, cyber-criminals and in some situations, federal agencies would have “an interest” in the data stored in your smartphone. Apps can collect all sorts of data and transmit it to the app-maker and/or sell it to third-party advertisers.
                    Ads from advertising networks running on some apps may change smartphone settings and take contact and other information without your permission.
